# Tkinter-Alarm-Clock
A simple Python-based alarm clock application built using the Tkinter library for the GUI. It allows users to set a specific time for an alarm, and it plays a sound when the alarm goes off. The project demonstrates threading for non-blocking alarm functionality and includes a fallback beep if the sound file is missing.
